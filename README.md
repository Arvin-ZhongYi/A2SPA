NOTE: this is a partially working (well, not working :) spike to test areas in conjunction with ASP.Net Core MVC and Angular 2

for sanity sake, stick to main branch ! 

Curently picking ideas from areas here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas
and

#### Prerequisites

Download and install ASP.Net Core here: http://asp.net 
If using Windows, use Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 with the latest ASP.Net core tooling updates. 

Install Typescript and Typings globally, as these will be used by the application.

npm install -g typescript
npm install -g typings
